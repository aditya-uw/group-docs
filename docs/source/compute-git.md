## 1) Starting with git/GitHub
#### a) This [tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) explains the differences between git and GitHub and walks its readers through all the basic steps to get started with GitHub.

## 2) Repositories:
#### a) The first place we recommend is the GitHub group's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories) of repository management.

#### b) Here is a great [guide](https://github.blog/2023-08-04-a-checklist-and-guide-to-get-your-repository-collaboration-ready/#get-started) for understanding the resposibilities for maintaining a repository.

There are many things you can do with a GitHub repository. The 2 major actions would be to fork the repository or clone it.
We recommend following this [link](https://www.theserverside.com/answer/Git-fork-vs-clone-Whats-the-difference) to understand the difference between these two actions.
### Forks:
#### a) This workflow [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow#:~:text=The%20main%20advantage%20of%20the,push%20to%20the%20official%20repository.) provides a great explanation for git forks and where they stand in the entire workflow when contributing to a project.

### Clones:
#### a) This workflow [tutorial](https://www.warp.dev/terminus/git-clone-ssh) will be useful when beginning to clone git repositories to understand the differences between using HTTPS and SSH and how we set up SSH for cloning.

## 3) Branches
#### a) This is a great [breakdown](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) of how branches can be created and how they differ from the main/master of git repositories.

#### b) We also recommend using the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#) to understand more on branches.
