### Brainstorming items to add onto `start-git.md`

1. Getting started on your terminal.
   - What are the need-to-know commands for your terminal?
   - `ls`, `cd`, and `git status/pull/push/fetch/commit/`.
2. Repository:
   - What is a repository?
   - What can go into a repository?
   - Why use a repository?
   - What kinds of repositories are there?
   - .gitignore and other .git files that GitHub uses.
3. Differences between forking, cloning, and branching?
   - Upstream vs. Fork vs. Local Repository
4. Forking:
6. Cloning:
7. Branching:
   - What are branches?
   - Branch management: Creating branches and working on branches. 
   - How do multiple people work on one repository?
8. Commits:
   - Where do you commit when working on a project?
   - Resolving merge conflicts between branches.
   - Commit guidelines: how often, commit descriptions, ettiquete.
   - (Include that one resource on ettiquete that Mollie used)
9. Pushing commits
10. Pull requests
12. Miscellaneous that authors don't know:
    - Pytests and workflows.
    - GitHub actions.


Aditya will work on Forking/Cloning/Branching-related things
Mollie will work on Gettin started/Repository/Differences
Shahnaz will work on Commits/Push/Pull Requests

Materials we need:
1. Diagram of upstream vs. fork vs. clone.
2. Upstream vs. remote? Upstream vs. origin?
3. Origin = fork? Upstream = remote?
